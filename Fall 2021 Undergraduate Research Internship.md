# 2022 Research Opportunities

#### [Neuro-Inspired AI Lab](https://yoonlab.hanyang.ac.kr) @ Hanyang University

**[Project 1] Manifold learning from time-series data**

**[Project 2] Developing more expressive graph neural networks**

**[Project 3] Building exponential random graph models**

**Required skills/experiences**

- I'm looking for people who have basic python/R programming knowledge and have taken any undergraduate-level machine learning/deep learning/AI courses at HY. This is not a requirement, but is strongly recommended.
- Expertise in modern deep learning frameworks (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)

**Benefits**

- Opportunity to gain hands-on experience in ML/DL/AI research.

- Opportunity to design and conduct ML/DL/AI experiments.

- Opportunity for contributing to a top-tier academic publication.

  Depending on your commitment and contributions to the project, you will have an opportunity to co-author a research paper.
